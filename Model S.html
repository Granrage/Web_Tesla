  <font size="4"><br><br>Model S is a driver's car. The cabin combines meticulous noise engineering with Tesla's uniquely quiet powertrain to obtain the sound dynamics of a recording studio. 
  <br>The gem of the interior is the 17 inch touchscreen, which is angled toward the driver and includes both day and night modes for better visibility without distraction. 
  <br>It puts rich content at your fingertips and provides mobile connectivity so you can easily find your destination, favorite song or a new restaurant.<br><br></font>
